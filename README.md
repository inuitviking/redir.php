# redir.php
Firefox has a tendency to block mixed content, so this script was created to bypass that.

To use:
		<a href="redir.ph?url=http://example.com">Link</a>

The script checks the link if it has an SSL certificate, just in case one would put in an already SSL certified website with the wrong protocol or vise versa.
